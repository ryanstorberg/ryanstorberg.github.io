				<h2><time>Week 3 - May 30, 2014</time>A Few Things About JavaScript</h2>
				<p>I believe that JavaScript owes much of its popularity to jQuery and to Google. jQuery took the JavaScript language, along with its access to the DOM, and created a simpler way to access and manipulate the DOM. Where jQuery was lacking, since it was written in and is JavaScript, the web developer would be able to fill in the gap with pure JavaScript, building what would eventually resemble a jQuery quilt, sewn together with pure JavaScript. After Google created its suite of web apps, including, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc., and it all in JavaScript, things really began taking a positive turn for the language.</p>
				<p>Some good things about JavaScript include its learnability; its speed; its support by major browsers; its well-developed access to the DOM, enabling web developers to create dynamic web pages; its now extremely large community, including frameworks, best-practices, and even languages that compile to JavaScript, for those wanting to work with different syntax.</p>
				<p>JavaScript’s limitations are slowly eroding. It was once not able to function as a server-side language. Today this isn’t true. A programmer one had to deal with its “ugly” syntax and style. Today that programmer can write in Dart, or CoffeeScript, or similar.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 2 - May 25, 2014</time>Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning</h2>
				<p>There are four different element position types available in CSS, static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Each elements default position type is static, which positions the element in the regular flow of CSS, stacked in order if it's a block element, lined up in order if it's an inline element.</p>
				<p><span class="subtitle"><code>position: relative.</code></span> When positioning an element relatively, you're positioning it relative to itself, while also setting the stage for allowing greater control over the <em>absolute</em> positioning declaration. Also note that when an element is set to relative and its position moved, its previously occupied space remains a part of the natural flow of the elements, and the void remains unfilled.</p>
				<p><span class="subtitle"><code>position: absolute.</code></span> An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to either its nearest relatively positioned parent element, or the HTML document itself, if no relatively positioned parent element can be found. Unlike the relatively positioned element, the absolutely positioned element is taken out of the natural flow of the elements, and its void is filled by the next element in the HTML document.</p>
				<p><span class="subtitle"><code>position: fixed.</code></span> Fixed elements are positioned relative to the display of the device that is viewing the webpage. They don't move from their initial position, even when the page is scrolled. It is also taken out of the natural flow of the elements, just like absolutely positioned elements.</p>

				<p>I would recommend heading over to <a href="www.codepen.io">CodePen</a> to play around with these concepts yourself.</p>
