				<h2><time>Week 8 - July 6, 2014</time>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
				<p>I think that one of the most important things to consider when dealing with people is that their values, or the connections that they make between their actions and how they relate to their values, are going to be different than your own. Not everybody is will be aware that they’re doing wrong in your eyes, and you won’t always be aware when you’re doing wrong in somebody else’s eyes.</p>
				<p>I think that the most important behavior to follow up such a realization with is to communicate honestly, clearly, and often. I have a family member whose behavior towards other family members, and sometimes myself, became abominable in my eyes. I saw quickly that what people invested in her was far greater than what they got from her in return, and sometimes getting nothing in return at all. I decided that I wasn’t going to have anything to do with her until she started paying back her “relationship debt”. I told her this.</p>
				<p>At first, there was no noticeable change in her behavior. And there’s still no change. My actions made my life better. Other family members followed suit. They started spending their time with people who add value to their lives, and give as well as take.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 8 - July 6, 2014</time>Rails</h2>
				<p>Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a full-stack web application framework built upon the Ruby programming language. It was designed to make building web applications easier and faster.</p>
				<p>One of Rails’s greatest strengths is its conformity towards web development conventions. This allows web developers to set-up “skeleton” applications, where most of the major parts of their application are already in place. They then develop from this advanced starting point, cutting down dramatically on the time and energy it would have taken otherwise. This, of course, also poses some problems, and on occasion can be one of Rail’s weaknesses. If a developer’s application, in order to meet his own or his client’s specification’s, required a different, or unconventional “skeleton”, the developer would have to try to bend Rails to his will, or else start completely over without using the Rails framework.</p>
				<p>I have had no experience yet developing with Rails. Most of the technical information that I’ve read about it doesn’t make much sense to me at this point. I will revisit this article in the future, after having spent some personal time developing with Rails.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 8 - July 6, 2014</time>Bloggin to Learn</h2>
				<p>I'm torn as to whether or not blogging has helped me become a better web developer, which is, of course, my chief aim in attending Dev Bootcamp. Time spent blogging and thinking about what to blog about is time not spent programming and solving programming problems. If there was research conducted that tested the web development skills of two groups, one who spent 1000 hours actually programming, and the other who spent 900 hours programming and the other 100 hours blogging, I would hypothesize that the group that spent 1000 hours programming would have a higher skill level than the group that divided their time between blogging and programming.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 7 - June 29, 2014</time>SQL vs NoSQL</h2>
				<p>The differences between SQL and NoSQL databases should be considered before deciding which type to use for your next project.</p>
				<p>SQL is the older of the two. Developed in the 1970s, SQL was designed to store the data of some of the earliest applications. These applications were simpler than the applications we use today, and they also had fewer users accessing their databases. Developed in the 2000s, NoSQL was designed to meet the new demands of modern applications, and of technology use in general.</p>
				<p>Instead of the rigid tables of SQL, NoSQL introduced more dynamic database types. These new databases allowed the mapping of more complex application data. This allowed the data to maintain its intra-relational integrity or organic structure, instead of being tweezed apart and forced into columns and rows.</p>
				<p>Besides a data structure that can better model real-world information, many argue that NoSQL databases are faster to develop with. One of the reasons argued is that adding and taking away new collection fields are much easier, not requiring a table to migrate to a new schema because of the addition of a new column. Many also argue that NoSQL databases perform writes and reads faster.</p>
				<p>Although NoSQL is newer, and may appear to be a better performer in many aspects, what you ultimately choose to build your database with should depend on your project. If it’s simple, SQL will work just fine. You’ll also find tons of information about it online and in books because it’s popular and it’s been around for almost 40 years. If your project handles complex data, or will have large amounts of data or users, maybe NoSQL is worth looking into. Some of the coolest applications around today use NoSQL.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 7 - June 29, 2014</time>Values</h2>
				<p>There have been many happy, proud, and satisfied moments in my life, and there isn’t a common thread that I can identify that links them all to a single value or a few. None stand out as most often pronounced, or most frequent in appearing.</p>
				<p>Since it’s 12:51 AM right now, and I really want to go to bed and go to sleep, I’m going to choose the value that is keeping me here right now until I finish this blog entry—will-power. I think will-power is important to me because I see it as the enforcer of future visions. It works hand-in-hand with foresight; the two together form a large part of what makes the homo-sapien so awesome.</p>
				<p>I think that I succeed at exercising will-power 60-80% of the time, or a 3-4/5.</p>
				<p>The last piece of advice that was asked of me was by my brother regarding a relationship that he was in.</p>
				<p>If I’m ever feeling down at DBC, it may be because I lost sight of why I’m doing what I’m doing. It would probably help for me to take a pause at that time and reflect on my current course for reasurence.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 6 - June 19, 2014</time>Objectively Functional</h2>
				<p>Two of the more popular programming paradigms are functional programming and object-oriented programming. I will summarize each in the two following paragraphs.</p>
				<p>Functional programming can be thought of as programming <i>without</i> explicit organization. It functions, in its less-inspired form, much like a Rube Goldberg machine, and in its more-inspired form, like some efficient factory machine. When you look at such a factory machine as its non-creator, you can see that most of what it's composition is probably necessary to keep it working. It might not be obvious, however, what that composition is doing. It's even less obvious how it might be expanded or improved upon.</p>
				<p>Object-oriented programming, on the other hand, can be thought of as programming <i>with</i> explicit organization. Concepts, both large and small, in an object-oriented programming environment (which are essentially snippets of functional programming), are encapsulated in syntax called classes. These classes or concepts can be structured hierarchically or in parallel, each serving as a template to make instances (individuals) of themselves. The structure of an object-oriented program is more human-readable, and therefore easier to expand or improve upon.</p>
				<p>Which is a better programming paradigm is difficult to say. It would probably depend on what the programmer's goal is. For a quick, one-off, program, functional programming may be all that's needed. For a larger program, with a long predicted lifespan, object-oriented programming will probably be the way to go.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 6 - June 19, 2014</time>Title</h2>
				<p>I can’t say that I’ve ever felt stereotype threat as it’s outlined in the assigned readings. And even after the readings, however, I still don’t feel like I have much to say about the subject in any depth.</p>
				<p>I could try to imagine what it might be like for other groups with some success. Some words come to mind: hopeless, resigned, affected, self-limiting, socially stifled.</p>
				<p>If I was confronted with a situation that gave me the opportunity to right any stereotype-driven wrongs, I would do so. Life is hard enough without people’s interference. Intervention, however, is something that I can get onboard with.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 5 - June 13, 2014</time>Broken Glass</h2>
				<p>Object-oriented programming allows the programmer to think about his code in a more natural way. Humans tend to break up reality into separate objects and events (sometimes arbitrarily, sometimes obviously), assigning each their own characteristics. Unless a theoretical physicist, or a philosopher by trade, we don’t tend to think of reality as one, indivisible mass; or events as an arbitrary, isolated, slice of action in one grand cosmic unfolding. We see cats. We see dogs. We see glasses of water. Each of these things we see as behaving a certain way, and interacting with and between each other a certain way.</p>
				<p>Let’s consider that glass of water again. If we were to model it in a computer program, depending on the level of detail we were trying to achieve, some of the characteristics we might consider attributing to our glass of water object would be the glass height, its opacity, the shape of its opening, whether it has an engraved pattern on its side, how full it is, the temperature of the water, and how many pieces it may shatter into based on the height of its fall (considers glass thickness, height, width, angle of fall, and overall structure and circumstance of the glass). These are just a few, amongst many, many, of the possible characteristics that may be attributed to a glass of water. Some of the characteristics may be defined as attributes (states), others as methods (actions). If we wanted even greater versatility, instead of a class for a glass of water, we can model a class for just an empty glass. Upon initialization, we can fill it with whatever kind of liquid we want, at whatever capacity, and at whatever temperature.</p>
				<p>Here’s an example of what a (very simple) glass Class may look like:</p>

				<h2><time>Week 5 - June 13, 2014</time>On Pairing and Feedback</h2>
				<p>Pairing, or live collaboration, is a mixed-bag. Some programming problems were solved while actively engaged with a pair, others were solved upon disengagement. Before pairing, the experience of solving programming problems involved a lot of staring blankly into space. And because you were on your own schedule, there was no undercurrent of anxiety telling you to think faster. This undercurrent can retard the programming thinking process, and delay the emergence of an effective answer. I picture pairing becoming more beneficial with practice, both in general, and with particular pairs.</p>
				<p>My feedback has been warm and friendly. My previous pairs were helpful enough to include advice that I could use to make for better pairing in the future. One piece of advice was to better communicate when I was going to think or experiment on my own. During these times my pair felt that I may not have been giving his input my full-attention, and that if he knew what I was doing, he would have saved some breath and waited to express himself.</p>
				<p>Writing feedback was challenging. Sometimes it was difficult to think of a valid criticism. I think that as the material advances, there’ll be greater opportunity to teach and learn from each other.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 4 - June 8, 2014</time>Let's Map!</h2>
				<p>The #map method has come in handy for me many times before. Unlike the #each method, which returns, upon iteration completion,
				the same data that was put into it, the #map method returns 
				an altered version of that data.</p>
				<p>Let's say you call the #map method on an array of the lowercase alphabet:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
				abc = ('a'..'z').map do |letter|<br />
				letter += " is a letter"<br />
				end<br />
				<br />
				puts abc[3] #=> "d is a letter"
				</code></div>
				<p>Compare this to the #each method:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
				abc = ('a'..'z').each do |letter|<br />
				letter += " is a letter"<br />
				end<br />
				<br />
				puts abc[3] #=> "d"
				</code></div>
				<p>You may have already started to think of scenarios where something like the #map method would come in handy. My advice is to go off and experiment.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 4 - June 8, 2014</time>Skill Blocks</h2>
				<p>The tech industry, like most industries, I think, that require refined, technical, skillsets, has a shortage of hireable employees.</p>
				<p>Homo sapiens have spent 99%+ of their existence evolving in, and for, environments outside of civilization, in smaller, hunter-gatherer type groupings. The most they had to know was the personality types of the few people around them, the local flora and fauna, the local landscape and weather patterns, and who their friends and enemies were. The amount and complexity of information that is required for homo sapiens to learn now, having been built up, particularly, over the last few centuries, is asking for quite a lot.</p>
				<p>A biology student may go through college and graduate, and retain a fraction of what he was exposed to. Soon after, he might find himself with a job at a lab entering data into spreadsheets. Why not save a lot of money and time, and just learn how to enter biology data into spreadsheets? I think there's a lot of this type of stuff going on, in a lot of industries, inluding the tech industry.</p>
				<p>A solution is for workers to be more specific with what they learn, and for employers to be more accurate with what they need. Instead of degrees that take years and fortunes to aquire, students should focus on aquiring "Skill Blocks". Instead of a job listing requiring an employee to possess a degree in a generic, overarching, domain, it asks for specific "Skill Blocks". The "Skill Blocks" should cost a fraction of what a traditional degree costs, and take a fraction of the time to aquire. The knowledge and/or skill retention rate should also be higher. And finally, the "Skill Blocks" should be standardized across all educational institutions. At the current pace of technology, and with homo sapiens' inate cognitive limitations, I think that a modular-type education system should be the way of the future.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 3 - May 30, 2014</time>A Few Things About JavaScript</h2>
				<p>I believe that JavaScript owes much of its popularity to jQuery and to Google. jQuery took the JavaScript language, along with its access to the DOM, and created a simpler way to access and manipulate the DOM. Where jQuery was lacking, since it was written in and is JavaScript, the web developer would be able to fill in the gap with pure JavaScript, building what would eventually resemble a jQuery quilt, sewn together with pure JavaScript. After Google created its suite of web apps, including, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc., and it all in JavaScript, things really began taking a positive turn for the language.</p>
				<p>Some good things about JavaScript include its learnability; its speed; its support by major browsers; its well-developed access to the DOM, enabling web developers to create dynamic web pages; its now extremely large community, including frameworks, best-practices, and even languages that compile to JavaScript, for those wanting to work with different syntax.</p>
				<p>JavaScript’s limitations are slowly eroding. It was once not able to function as a server-side language. Today this isn’t true. A programmer one had to deal with its “ugly” syntax and style. Today that programmer can write in Dart, or CoffeeScript, or similar.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 3 - May 30, 2014</time>My Thinking Style and Learning</h2>
				<p>Since all thinking types, regardless of which, require time to study and practice the subject, I think that the biggest struggle for me so far, regarding the Phase 0 curriculum, has been finding productive time to get the challenges done.</p>
				<p>I think that my learning style, multimodal, and my thinking styles, equal parts abstract sequential and concrete random (followed very closely with concrete sequential, and further behind with abstract random), are well-suited for learning and practicing web development. I just need time to study and experiment. I currently work a full-time job, which costs additional time in travel, as it’s a considerable distance from my home.</p>
				<p>Right now, my strategy is to use the better parts of the weekends, but after I leave my job, it’ll be to use the better parts of the week.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 2 - May 25, 2014</time>Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning</h2>
				<img src="images/positions.png" alt="Seawater">
				<p>There are four different element position types available in CSS, static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Each elements default position type is static, which positions the element in the regular flow of CSS, stacked in order if it's a block element, lined up in order if it's an inline element.</p>
				<p><span class="subtitle"><code>position: relative.</code></span> When positioning an element relatively, you're positioning it relative to itself, while also setting the stage for allowing greater control over the <em>absolute</em> positioning declaration. Also note that when an element is set to relative and its position moved, its previously occupied space remains a part of the natural flow of the elements, and the void remains unfilled.</p>
				<p><span class="subtitle"><code>position: absolute.</code></span> An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to either its nearest relatively positioned parent element, or the HTML document itself, if no relatively positioned parent element can be found. Unlike the relatively positioned element, the absolutely positioned element is taken out of the natural flow of the elements, and its void is filled by the next element in the HTML document.</p>
				<p><span class="subtitle"><code>position: fixed.</code></span> Fixed elements are positioned relative to the display of the device that is viewing the webpage. They don't move from their initial position, even when the page is scrolled. It is also taken out of the natural flow of the elements, just like absolutely positioned elements.</p>

				<p>I would recommend heading over to <a href="www.codepen.io">CodePen</a> to play around with these concepts yourself.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 1 - May 18, 2014</time>My Favorite Websites</h2>
				<img src="images/seawater.jpg" alt="Seawater">
				<p>The first two of my choices have become staples in my and a few billion other people's lives, revolutionizing the internet and ecommerce, respectively. The third choice is an admired attempt at trying to revolutionize education.</p>

				<h4>Google</h4>

				<p>Whether I love the design of Google’s many websites or not, they’re some of my favorite. Google Drive, with its awesome online editing and collaborating features is on of my most used web apps, along with Gmail. I don’t use Google’s homepage for searching, as I mostly just use the search bar in whatever browser I’m using, and I don't typically use Gmail in the browser, so I’ll focus on Google Drive.</p>

				<p>When looking at Google Drive, the most noticeable feature is the grid that presents my files in an ordered way. This part stands out because there isn’t much else happening, and it looks rough and packed together compared with the white space surrounding it. The second most obvious thing is the red “Create” button in the upper right corner. What tries to make up for its lack of size and texture by being a striking color.</p>

				<p>I’d describe Google Drive’s appearance as basic and practical. It has everything you need and nothing you don’t. The graphics that it uses tend to serve a purpose, so I’d call it purposeful and non-extraneous. And because of its huge customer base, it’s not daring.</p>

				<p>Google Drive keeps the user’s files safe, accessible from any internet connected machine, and allows simultaneous creation and editing of documents with other users. Its content is user generated or curated.</p>

				<p>The purpose of Google Drive is provide a platform for document storage and creation and sharing. Its design is structured to facilitate theses activities. It’s practical and serious. It means business. Its fun and productive.</p>

				<p>Google is the master of search, at the very top of the page is a search bar for finding any of the user’s documents, along with options for a more detailed search. The content can be displayed in the grid according to a certain order as well, such as the date that the documents were modified.</p>

				<p>I feel empowered using Google Drive.</p>

				<p>The only advertisement is for the computer app that allows the syncing of the user’s files to their personal computer.</p>

				<h4>Amazon</h4>

				<p>Amazon solves the huge problem that is shopping in brick and mortar stores, gas wasted, out-of-stocks, long lines, not knowing the value of what you’re paying for. Amazon saves its users a lot of time and a lot of money. Amazon let’s them keep a little more of their life to spend on other, more worthwhile, things.</p>

				<p>Amazon’s site is another practical website, like Google Drive. Its very nature of being an online department store, I’m sure, is very challenging when making design decisions to keep it from looking like a mess. There’s so much that has to be conveyed to the users, and there’s a lot at stake (time and money).</p>

				<p>Nothing stands out. Every inch of the screen is used to display a product or service advertisement.</p>

				<p>Amazon is cluttered, but basic. It could be fun, but it could also be serious; much has to do with the customer’s searching or browsing history. It’s bazaarish.</p>

				<p>Amazon’s content is basically images, videos, and descriptions of products and services.</p>

				<p>Amazon tries to be focused sometimes. They have some showcase areas on their home screen, and it does work initially to draw my attention. The showcase areas are hierarchically ordered, the most important located at the top, and then moving down along the right side through the lesser important. This is the pattern that my eyes usually follow.</p>

				<p>It’s very simple to search for things on Amazon. The homepage has a search bar at the top, and the results are often relevant. There is also a drop-down menu for browsing departments, and even sub-departments. No matter where you navigate to on the website, those two options for finding things tag along.</p>

				<p>I often feel satisfied after using Amazon, knowing how much time and money I probably saved.</p>

				<p>Amazon sells most consumer goods. They also display advertisements.</p>

				<h4>Khan Academy</h4>

				<p>Salmon Khan’s goal is to eventually furnish Khan Academy with all domains of human knowledge, as well as create accompanying exercises to test the user’s knowledge and develop their skills, and to do it all at no charge to its users, and without advertisements. They’re off to a great start.</p>

				<p>The Dashboard is filled with useful information about the user’s current progress. The most noticeable thing at first glance is the wide column of skills to practice, generated automatically based on the user’s current progress and the last time they practiced those skills. The second most noticeable thing is the tall column on the right side that contains a mini grid. Each square in the grid represents a skill or concept in mathematics (eventually there will be other subjects), and is color coded based on how well the use knows that knowledge or has that skill set. There’s also a search bar at the very top to live search for any of the thousands of videos on the site.</p>

				<p>Khan Academy is fun. It uses gamification to encourage sustained progress. It’s simple.</p>

				<p>Khan Academy tries to solve the problem of not having access to education or not having access to good education. It’s intended to be used as a standalone or as a supplement to traditional classroom settings.</p>

				<p>It’s content is fun and light-hearted to serious. It’s always purposeful.</p>

				<p>In addition to the search bar that I mentioned (which includes searching video transcripts), there is also a drop down menu to browse according to topic and subtopic.</p>

				<p>I feel empowered and accomplished after spending time on Khan Academy, and hopeful for humankind’s future.</p>

				<p>Khan Academy is free to its users and runs as a non-profit. There are no advertisements.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 1 - May 18, 2014</time>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
				<p>I think my inutition was inline with Shereef's take on the DBC culture. My impression has been that you will get out of it what you put into it, and that there's a strong enphasis on interpersonal relationships as well (I'm an introvert, myself, so I'm looking forward to challenging myself in this area, right alongside learning how to program). I appreciated each of Shereef's metaphors. I'm nervous and excited as I stand ready to take the plunge.</p>

				<p>I look forward to meeting everybody and getting started. Good luck to each of you.</p>
