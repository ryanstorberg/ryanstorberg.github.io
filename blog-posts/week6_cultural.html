				<h2><time>Week 6 - June 19, 2014</time>Objectively Functional</h2>
				<p>Two of the more popular programming paradigms are functional programming and object-oriented programming. I will summarize each in the two following paragraphs.</p>
				<p>Functional programming can be thought of as programming <i>without</i> explicit organization. It functions, in its less-inspired form, much like a Rube Goldberg machine, and in its more-inspired form, like some efficient factory machine. When you look at such a factory machine as its non-creator, you can see that most of what it's composition is probably necessary to keep it working. It might not be obvious, however, what that composition is doing. It's even less obvious how it might be expanded or improved upon.</p>
				<p>Object-oriented programming, on the other hand, can be thought of as programming <i>with</i> explicit organization. Concepts, both large and small, in an object-oriented programming environment (which are essentially snippets of functional programming), are encapsulated in syntax called classes. These classes or concepts can be structured hierarchically or in parallel, each serving as a template to make instances (individuals) of themselves. The structure of an object-oriented program is more human-readable, and therefore easier to expand or improve upon.</p>
				<p>Which is a better programming paradigm is difficult to say. It would probably depend on what the programmer's goal is. For a quick, one-off, program, functional programming may be all that's needed. For a larger program, with a long predicted lifespan, object-oriented programming will probably be the way to go.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 6 - June 19, 2014</time>Title</h2>
				<p>I can’t say that I’ve ever felt stereotype threat as it’s outlined in the assigned readings. And even after the readings, however, I still don’t feel like I have much to say about the subject in any depth.</p>
				<p>I could try to imagine what it might be like for other groups with some success. Some words come to mind: hopeless, resigned, affected, self-limiting, socially stifled.</p>
				<p>If I was confronted with a situation that gave me the opportunity to right any stereotype-driven wrongs, I would do so. Life is hard enough without people’s interference. Intervention, however, is something that I can get onboard with.</p>
