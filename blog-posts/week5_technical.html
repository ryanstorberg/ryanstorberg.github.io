				<h2><time>Week 5 - June 13, 2014</time>Broken Glass</h2>
				<p>Object-oriented programming allows the programmer to think about his code in a more natural way. Humans tend to break up reality into separate objects and events (sometimes arbitrarily, sometimes obviously), assigning each their own characteristics. Unless a theoretical physicist, or a philosopher by trade, we don’t tend to think of reality as one, indivisible mass; or events as an arbitrary, isolated, slice of action in one grand cosmic unfolding. We see cats. We see dogs. We see glasses of water. Each of these things we see as behaving a certain way, and interacting with and between each other a certain way.</p>
				<p>Let’s consider that glass of water again. If we were to model it in a computer program, depending on the level of detail we were trying to achieve, some of the characteristics we might consider attributing to our glass of water object would be the glass height, its opacity, the shape of its opening, whether it has an engraved pattern on its side, how full it is, the temperature of the water, and how many pieces it may shatter into based on the height of its fall (considers glass thickness, height, width, angle of fall, and overall structure and circumstance of the glass). These are just a few, amongst many, many, of the possible characteristics that may be attributed to a glass of water. Some of the characteristics may be defined as attributes (states), others as methods (actions). If we wanted even greater versatility, instead of a class for a glass of water, we can model a class for just an empty glass. Upon initialization, we can fill it with whatever kind of liquid we want, at whatever capacity, and at whatever temperature.</p>
				<p>Here’s an example of what a (very simple) glass Class may look like:</p>

				<h2><time>Week 5 - June 13, 2014</time>On Pairing and Feedback</h2>
				<p>Pairing, or live collaboration, is a mixed-bag. Some programming problems were solved while actively engaged with a pair, others were solved upon disengagement. Before pairing, the experience of solving programming problems involved a lot of staring blankly into space. And because you were on your own schedule, there was no undercurrent of anxiety telling you to think faster. This undercurrent can retard the programming thinking process, and delay the emergence of an effective answer. I picture pairing becoming more beneficial with practice, both in general, and with particular pairs.</p>
				<p>My feedback has been warm and friendly. My previous pairs were helpful enough to include advice that I could use to make for better pairing in the future. One piece of advice was to better communicate when I was going to think or experiment on my own. During these times my pair felt that I may not have been giving his input my full-attention, and that if he knew what I was doing, he would have saved some breath and waited to express himself.</p>
				<p>Writing feedback was challenging. Sometimes it was difficult to think of a valid criticism. I think that as the material advances, there’ll be greater opportunity to teach and learn from each other.</p>
