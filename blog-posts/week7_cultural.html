				<h2><time>Week 7 - June 29, 2014</time>SQL vs NoSQL</h2>
				<p>The differences between SQL and NoSQL databases should be considered before deciding which type to use for your next project.</p>
				<p>SQL is the older of the two. Developed in the 1970s, SQL was designed to store the data of some of the earliest applications. These applications were simpler than the applications we use today, and they also had fewer users accessing their databases. Developed in the 2000s, NoSQL was designed to meet the new demands of modern applications, and of technology use in general.</p>
				<p>Instead of the rigid tables of SQL, NoSQL introduced more dynamic database types. These new databases allowed the mapping of more complex application data. This allowed the data to maintain its intra-relational integrity or organic structure, instead of being tweezed apart and forced into columns and rows.</p>
				<p>Besides a data structure that can better model real-world information, many argue that NoSQL databases are faster to develop with. One of the reasons argued is that adding and taking away new collection fields are much easier, not requiring a table to migrate to a new schema because of the addition of a new column. Many also argue that NoSQL databases perform writes and reads faster.</p>
				<p>Although NoSQL is newer, and may appear to be a better performer in many aspects, what you ultimately choose to build your database with should depend on your project. If it’s simple, SQL will work just fine. You’ll also find tons of information about it online and in books because it’s popular and it’s been around for almost 40 years. If your project handles complex data, or will have large amounts of data or users, maybe NoSQL is worth looking into. Some of the coolest applications around today use NoSQL.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 7 - June 29, 2014</time>Values</h2>
				<p>There have been many happy, proud, and satisfied moments in my life, and there isn’t a common thread that I can identify that links them all to a single value or a few. None stand out as most often pronounced, or most frequent in appearing.</p>
				<p>Since it’s 12:51 AM right now, and I really want to go to bed and go to sleep, I’m going to choose the value that is keeping me here right now until I finish this blog entry—will-power. I think will-power is important to me because I see it as the enforcer of future visions. It works hand-in-hand with foresight; the two together form a large part of what makes the homo-sapien so awesome.</p>
				<p>I think that I succeed at exercising will-power 60-80% of the time, or a 3-4/5.</p>
				<p>The last piece of advice that was asked of me was by my brother regarding a relationship that he was in.</p>
				<p>If I’m ever feeling down at DBC, it may be because I lost sight of why I’m doing what I’m doing. It would probably help for me to take a pause at that time and reflect on my current course for reasurence.</p>
