				<h3>May 18th, 2014</h3>
				<h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
				<p>I think my inutition was inline with Shereef's take on the DBC culture. My impression has been that you will get out of it what you put into it, and that there's a strong enphasis on interpersonal relationships as well (I'm an introvert, myself, so I'm looking forward to challenging myself in this area, right alongside learning how to program). I appreciated each of Shereef's metaphors. I'm nervous and excited as I stand ready to take the plunge.</p>

				<p>I look forward to meeting everybody and getting started. Good luck to each of you.</p>
