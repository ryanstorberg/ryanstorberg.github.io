				<h2><time>Week 3 - May 30, 2014</time>A Few Things About JavaScript</h2>
				<p>I believe that JavaScript owes much of its popularity to jQuery and to Google. jQuery took the JavaScript language, along with its access to the DOM, and created a simpler way to access and manipulate the DOM. Where jQuery was lacking, since it was written in and is JavaScript, the web developer would be able to fill in the gap with pure JavaScript, building what would eventually resemble a jQuery quilt, sewn together with pure JavaScript. After Google created its suite of web apps, including, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc., and it all in JavaScript, things really began taking a positive turn for the language.</p>
				<p>Some good things about JavaScript include its learnability; its speed; its support by major browsers; its well-developed access to the DOM, enabling web developers to create dynamic web pages; its now extremely large community, including frameworks, best-practices, and even languages that compile to JavaScript, for those wanting to work with different syntax.</p>
				<p>JavaScript’s limitations are slowly eroding. It was once not able to function as a server-side language. Today this isn’t true. A programmer one had to deal with its “ugly” syntax and style. Today that programmer can write in Dart, or CoffeeScript, or similar.</p>

				<h2><time>Week 3 - May 30, 2014</time>My Thinking Style and Learning</h2>
				<p>Since all thinking types, regardless of which, require time to study and practice the subject, I think that the biggest struggle for me so far, regarding the Phase 0 curriculum, has been finding productive time to get the challenges done.</p>
				<p>I think that my learning style, multimodal, and my thinking styles, equal parts abstract sequential and concrete random (followed very closely with concrete sequential, and further behind with abstract random), are well-suited for learning and practicing web development. I just need time to study and experiment. I currently work a full-time job, which costs additional time in travel, as it’s a considerable distance from my home.</p>
				<p>Right now, my strategy is to use the better parts of the weekends, but after I leave my job, it’ll be to use the better parts of the week.</p>
